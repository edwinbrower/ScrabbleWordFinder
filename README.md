# ScrabbleWordFinder
User gives an input and the result is all the possible words from those words.

Make a Scrabble word finder app with both a server and client.

On the client, the UI simply is a text input for your up-to-7 letters in your Scrabble rack, and a button to send the letters to the server.

On the server side, *efficiently* find words which can be made with those letters, within a big dictionary. 

Display the list of found words on the client side.
